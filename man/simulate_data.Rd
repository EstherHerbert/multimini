\title{Simulate data for minimisation simulations}
\usage{
simulate_data(sampsize, factors)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampsize}{the desired sample size of the data, i.e., the sample size
of your prospective trial.}

\item{factors}{a list of factors, each a list containing two items. The first
is \code{levels} which is either a vector of the level names OR the number of
levels. The second item is either \code{props}, a vector of proportions equal to
the number of levels in the factor; OR prop.dist which is a named vector
containing the mean and sd of the proportions.}
}
\description{
Given a list of factors with specified levels and proportions, and a sample
size, this function simulates data for use in \code{\link[=simulate_mini]{simulate_mini()}}.
}
\examples{
simulate_data(factors = list(sex = list(levels = c("M", "F"),
                                        props = c(0.5, 0.5)),
                             site = list(levels = 12,
                                         prop.dist = c(mean = 0.1, sd = 0.05))),
              sampsize = 150)
